# 3D Terrain Shooter Game

## Overview

A 3D game built with a custom C++ graphics framework featuring dynamic terrain, physics, and multiple game modes. This project demonstrates real-time rendering techniques, game physics implementation, and gameplay programming.

## Features

- **Dynamic Terrain System**
  - Terrain generation based on sinusoidals
  - Real-time terrain deformation from weapon impacts

- **Physics & Gameplay**
  - Gravity and collision detection
  - Character movement mechanics
  - Projectile trajectory calculations

- **Weapon System**
  - Multiple weapon types with different damage and fire rates
  - Lootable weapon crates with random drops

- **Game Modes**
  - Real-time action mode
  - Turn-based tactical mode
    
- **Item System**
  - Random crate spawning
  - Health pickups and power-ups
  - Weapon upgrades

## Technical Implementation

This project was built using a custom OpenGL-based graphics framework. My contributions include:

- Implementing 3D mesh generation for game objects and terrain
- Developing the game physics engine including gravity and collisions
- Creating the weapon system with projectile mechanics
- Building the item/loot system with random drops
- Implementing dual game modes (real-time and turn-based)
- Designing and coding terrain generation and deformation algorithms
